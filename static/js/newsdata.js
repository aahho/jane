		"summary": "At the midnight hour of July 1, 2017, the then President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Goods and Services Tax (GST) at the historic central hall of the Parliament. The new tax was to simplify the tax system, get rid of a chain of different indirect taxes, enhancing the ease of doing business by creating a national market system across India. This was believed to be India’s biggest tax reform since independence. But the government missed some reforms that could have been made for the women of new India. The government had the chance to completely reform the taxation system of India. They should have made sure that the essential goods and services are not taxed.",

		"summary": "For the past few days, grief and loss have been recurring themes in most of the things I’ve read. I read Paul Kalanithi’s memoir, “When Breath Becomes Air”. Paul was a neurosurgeon who was diagnosed with a life-threatening lung tumour which unfortunately claimed his life in 2015. His memoir shares his desire to leave behind a legacy in the form of this book. The book deals with man’s never-ending quest to find purpose in life, particularly when faced with mortality. His wife, Lucy, shares how she struggles to make sense of her and her daughter’s life after this tragic setback. It was a sombre read, the kind that makes one realize how our perspectives and wishes change as we begin to understand that the years we once thought we had are now mere months or weeks.",

There is no dearth of perspective among the common strata of the society about this region of conflict and controversy, which has been at the heart of a long standing dispute since 1947 between India and Pakistan and more recently also involving China. While there have been huge discussions, deliberations and debates regarding the presence and role of the Indian Armed Forces and the AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act ), very little has been spoken about the Kashmiri economy of the pre conflict era, its stagnation and overdependence on the center.",

They are sent by e-mail from the Obama headquarters in Chicago to reporters who have interviewed campaign officials under one major condition: the press office has veto power over what statements can be quoted and attributed by name”. In other words any quote from the Obama campaign that appears in media is pre-censored by his press office. Out in the US they are now calling it “quote approval” or “message approval”. In India the govt and the media are creating “phenomenon and semantics” to create fear and through it muzzle free speech. The phenomenon here is to use the Assam violence and subsequent events to create fear and panic and distract from many other real issues. The semantics: Spreading hate, images inciting violence, hate-speech and communal threats! And all of this mainly coming from only one source: Social media on the internet.",

That we won’t be ignored as a useless clump of 500-600 million people that don’t belong to a clear cut vote-bank, and are thus irrelevant in the democratic scheme of things. That India will finally become a country that values merit, instead of caste and community.",

And the prime mover of this new rule, according to sources, is BJP president Amit Shah, who has been unequivocal about his stand on cow slaughter. 'One of the biggest challenges before India is how to save its cattle wealth from perishing,' Shah has told india today on numerous occasions.

As democratic politics is first and foremost a symbolic contest for representation, the choice of a Dalit candidate was a move that was widely described as another 'masterstroke' by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. So formidable was the first-mover advantage the NDA gained by selecting a Dalit candidate for the presidency that the Congress's Meira Kumar, also a Dalit, became an obvious choice as candidate for the 17-party mahagathbandhan. However, paradoxically, while choosing candidates from Dalit backgrounds, the leadership across political parties has been silent on the enormous costs the country's taxpayers bear to house and maintain the office of the Presidency.",
