This was believed to be India’s biggest tax reform since independence. But the government missed some reforms that could have been made for the women of new India. The government had the chance to completely reform the taxation system of India. They should have made sure that the essential goods and services are not taxed.",

His memoir shares his desire to leave behind a legacy in the form of this book. The book deals with man’s never-ending quest to find purpose in life, particularly when faced with mortality. His wife, Lucy, shares how she struggles to make sense of her and her daughter’s life after this tragic setback. It was a sombre read, the kind that makes one realize how our perspectives and wishes change as we begin to understand that the years we once thought we had are now mere months or weeks.",

In other words any quote from the Obama campaign that appears in media is pre-censored by his press office. Out in the US they are now calling it “quote approval” or “message approval”. In India the govt and the media are creating “phenomenon and semantics” to create fear and through it muzzle free speech. The phenomenon here is to use the Assam violence and subsequent events to create fear and panic and distract from many other real issues.

		"summary": "In its 70th year of Independence, the government has chosen a Dalit candidate for its highest office of the head of the state for the second time. Ram Nath Kovind, former governor of Bihar, is the second Scheduled Caste presidential candidate after K.R. Narayanan became the country's 10th, and the first Dalit, president in 1997. As democratic politics is first and foremost a symbolic contest for representation, the choice of a Dalit candidate was a move that was widely described as another 'masterstroke' by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. So formidable was the first-mover advantage the NDA gained by selecting a Dalit candidate for the presidency that the Congress's Meira Kumar, also a Dalit, became an obvious choice as candidate for the 17-party mahagathbandhan. However, paradoxically, while choosing candidates from Dalit backgrounds, the leadership across political parties has been silent on the enormous costs the country's taxpayers bear to house and maintain the office of the Presidency.",
